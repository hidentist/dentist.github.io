Our primary goal is to keep our offices open so that we may continue to provide exemplary medical care to our patient families all while implementing social
distancing methods. 

**To effectively carry out the separation between well visits and sick visits, as well as limit exposure, you may notice the following changes:**

 * Our cleaning procedures have heightened. Both sick and well areas will be cleaned multiple times per day, in addition to the routine cleaning we have always provided.

 * Our waiting areas are closed hence we request you to call us and wait in your car until we ask you to enter.
